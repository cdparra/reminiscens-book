ReminiscensBook
===


A personal book creation UI for the [reminiscens](https://github.com/cdparra/reminiscens) project extended from the original [placebooks project](https://github.com/horizon-institute/Bridging-the-Rural-Divide--Placebooks). 

The goal of this project is to support the experience of reminiscence and story-telling through the collaborative creation of a lifebook of personal and non-personal memories.
